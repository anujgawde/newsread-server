# NewsRead Server

The **NewsRead Server** is the backend service powering the NewsRead application. It is designed to handle news fetching, storage, and text-to-speech (TTS) functionality. This server interacts with the [newsdata.io API](https://newsdata.io/) for fetching news articles and leverages **AWS Polly** for generating audio files, ensuring a seamless and efficient experience for the user.

This server is essential for running the **NewsRead** application. To view the client-side code and integrate it with this backend, refer to the [newsread](https://github.com/anujgawde/newsread) repository.
